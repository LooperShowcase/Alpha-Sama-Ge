    <p>Starting in July 2008, Converse sent around 180 cease-and-desist letters to
        over 30 companies that they claimed were violating the Chuck Taylor All Star
        trademark and selling so-called look-alike sneakers. In October 2014,
        Converse filed a lawsuit against 30 companies for allegedly infringing on
        its generic sneaker style's bumper toe, striped midsole, and toe cap. The
        brand argued that companies were violating an alleged common-law trademark
        by importing sneakers with similar elements. Several companies settled with
        Converse and they were dropped from the list.[27][28] In November 2015,
        Charles Bullock, chief administrative judge at the International Trade
        Commission, preliminarily ruled that several brands Converse filed against
        were violating Converse's outsole design trademarks, i.e. the pattern on the
        bottom of the sole of the shoe. The soles of the shoes are designed to allow
        players to jump or move in all directions. The diamond patter makes this
        possible.[11] Judge Bullock further ruled that while Skechers "Twinkle Toes"
        brands did share similarities to Converse, "Twinkle Toes" were different
        enough and marketed in a way for it not to be mistaken for Chuck Taylor
        All-Stars.[29] Judge Bullock also ruled that most of the shoes sold by
        Highline United under the Ash brand did not infringe and that Converse did
        not have a valid common law mark for its midsole. On June 23, 2016, the
        anniversary of the death of Chuck Taylor, the International Trade Commission
        ruled that Converse's alleged trade dress for the midsole design of a
        combined toe cap, toe bumper, and stripe was not entitled to trademark
        protection under the common law and found invalid Converse's federal
        trademark registration. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals
        for the Federal Circuit, which ruled that the ITC had used the wrong test
        and remanded the case. On remand, the ITC ruled that Converse's trade dress
        was protectable but not infringed.[30]

        although in a glance u wouldnt tell the diffrence between the classic
        sneakers vulcanized rubber sole and there cons traction rubber solde ,there
        are some significant changes between the two compared to traditional rubber
        sole our cons sole is made froma completly diffrent rubber compound wich
        offers better grip when youre on the skateboard deck
        <hr />
        with the extrodinary strains put on the skate shoes when doing tricks ,drops
        and grinds ,the laces must be equally durable to the rest of the shoe . the
        last thing any skater needs is their laces snapping or fraying mid trick
        .thats why the converse brand uses a highly durable cotton-polyester</p>
