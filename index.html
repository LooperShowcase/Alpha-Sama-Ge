      Converse (/ˈkɒnvərs/) is an American lifestyle brand that markets,
      distributes, and licenses footwear, apparel, and accessories. Founded by
      Marquis Mills Converse in 1908 as the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in
      Malden, Massachusetts, it has been acquired by several companies before
      becoming a subsidiary of Nike, Inc. in 2003.[3] Converse initially
      produced winterized rubber-soled shoes and boots. During World War II, it
      shifted manufacturing to make footwear for the military.[4] Initially, it
      was one of the few producers of athletic shoes and dominated the U.S.
      market, but lost its position in the 1970s as competitors introduced their
      styles.

      Forty-seven-year-old Marquis Mills Converse, a manager at a footwear
      manufacturing firm, opened the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in February
      1908, in Malden, Massachusetts.[5] The company was a rubber shoe
      manufacturer, and its early inventory included winterized rubber-soled
      footwear, galoshes, tennis shoes, and some non-footwear items like
      automobile tires. In summer of 1916, the Converse basketball line was
      established; by 1917 the Converse All-Star basketball shoe was introduced
      and quickly became successful during World War 1 and the Spanish
      flu.[6][5][7] In 1923, basketball player Charles H. "Chuck" Taylor walked
      into Converse complaining of sore feet, and Converse gave him a job as a
      salesman and ambassador. He promoted the shoes around the U.S., and in
      1932 Taylor's signature was added to the All-Star patch on the high-topped
      sneakers. He continued this work until shortly before his death in
      1969.[8] Sales for the All-Star soared until 1929 when the company fell
      into bankruptcy. In 1939, Converse was sold to the Stone Family, who owned
      Converse until 1972 when the Eltra Corporation proposed an acquisition

      Converse started making an early basketball shoe in 1917 and redesigned it
      in 1922, when Chuck Taylor asked the company to create a better shoe with
      more support and flexibility. After Converse added Taylor's signature to
      the ankle patch they became known as Chuck Taylor All Stars. By the 1960s
      the company had captured about 70 to 80 percent of the basketball shoe
      market, but the shoe declined in popularity during the 1970s when
      basketball players wore competing brands. Chuck Taylor All-Stars enjoyed a
      comeback in popularity in the 1980s as retro-style casual footwear.[31][8]
      Chuck Taylor All-Stars have made an appearance in over 650 films, such as
      Back to the Future, I, Robot, Grease and Stand by Me.[32] David Tennant
      (playing the Tenth Doctor) wore red and cream versions of Hi-top Converse
      on science-fiction show Doctor Who.[33]

      In 1986, Converse released "The Weapon" basketball shoe. Manufactured in
      two color schemes to match the kit colors of basketball teams, it has been
      available in both high-top and low-cut varieties. It had leather
      construction throughout, including the inside heel which was also heavily
      padded for comfort. The first endorsers of "The Weapon" were Larry Bird
      and Magic Johnson, who were prominently featured in a Converse commercial
      set in Bird's hometown of French Lick, Indiana in 1985.[34] They were also
      worn by Axl Rose in the Guns N' Roses music video "Estranged". Converse
      re-released "The Weapon" classic (which Kobe Bryant wore at least three
      times in 2002 and Andre Miller wore in 2002 from mid-August to early
      September) several times from 1999 to 2003 and after, "The Loaded Weapon"
      in 2003, "The Weapon 86" in 2008 (and the Poorman version in 2009, and the
      John Varvatos version in 2012), "The Weapon EVO" in 2009, and its
      successor "The Star Player EVO" (sometimes reduced to "The Star Plyr EVO"
      or "The Star Ply EVO") in 2010.[

      n 2019, Converse returned to performance basketball with the All-Star Pro
      BB. Kelly Oubre Jr. was the first player to try out the new product,[38]
      which combined the traditional Converse silhouette with the contemporary
      Nike technology. Thereafter Converse signed Draymond Green in March
      2020,[39] Natasha Cloud (the first WNBA player) in June,[40] Shai
      Gilgeous-Alexander in July,[41] and, thereafter, Rudy Gay, P. J. Tucker,
      DeAndre' Bembry, De'Anthony Melton, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Immanuel
      Quickley, Deividas Sirvydis, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Richardson, David Duke
      Jr., Brandon Williams. Some of the aforementioned players also wear other
      brands.[42]

    skateboarding In the 1980s, Converse sponsored several influential skaters
    including Jason Jessee, Rodney Mullen, and Mark Rogowski.[45] Under the
    "Cons" name, Converse launched its skateboarding program in 2009 with a team
    of "ambassadors": Kenny Anderson, Anthony Pappalardo, Nick Trapasso, Sammy
    Baca, Ethan Fowler, Raymond Molinar, and Rune Glifberg.[46] In 2012, the
    company added Jason Jessee and Mike Anderson to its ambassadors team.[47] In
    August 2012, Converse sponsored a skate event at Huntington Beach,
    California, U.S. Trapasso, Tom Remillard,[48] Aaron Homoki, Greyson
    Fletcher, Ben Raemers, Ben Hatchell, Robbie Russo, and Ben Raybourn
    participated in the competition that was held. Raybourn eventually won the
    US$20,000 grand prize, and Homoki won the US$3,000 Best Trick contest.[49]
    As of July 2014, the Cons skateboard team consisted of original members
    Anderson, Trapasso, Baca, and Glifberg, while Jessee, Anderson, Julian
    Davidson, Remillard, Zered Basset, Ben Raemers, Jake Johnson, Eli Reed,
    Louie Lopez, Sage Elsesser, and Sean Pablo were subsequently added.[47]
    Bassett filmed a new advertisement that was broadcast online in July 2014,
    in which he skateboarded through New York City in a newly launched skate
    shoe version of the Converse Weapon model.[50] In February 2024, Converse
    and Phaidon launched a book titled Skateboard, about the history of
    skateboarding from the 1950s to today.[51][52] The book was put together by
    Jonathan Olivares, a designer and skater As of the 2020 United States
