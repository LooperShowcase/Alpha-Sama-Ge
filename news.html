          When an upstart rookie named Michael Jordan signed with Nike in the
          mid-1980s, sneaker history was madeâ€”a history whose reverberations are
          still being felt today, and which is so outsized that it even became
          the subject of a big-budget Hollywood fantasy starring Matt Damon and
          Ben Affleck. But while MJ was busy lacing up his new landmark Air
          Jordan, another much bigger sneaker was dominating the basketball
          landscape: the Converse Weapon, which became an instant phenomenon
          across the NBA when it launched in 1986. The sleek leather high-top
          sneaker was the shoe of choice for virtually every other major
          basketball star in the league at the time, from Isaiah Thomas and
          Kevin McHale to rivals Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.
